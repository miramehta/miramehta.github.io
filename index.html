                <h3>Seize the Moment -- Act Now on Global Fragility</h3>
                <p>As the beginning of the decade reveals itself to be an accumulation of 1920s tragedies rather than a time replete with the splendor of Gatsby-esque parties, Americans have not only united to support their communities but also begun to seize the unique opportunity this moment gives to meaningfully rethink policy and perspectives they have taken for granted.</p>

                <p>To be truly patriotic is not just to celebrate our country’s history, but to commit to seeking a better path forward. The first step to that is understanding not only the flaws that have emerged recently but also those which are embedded in the country’s DNA.</p>

                <p>As the president moves to restrict travel and immigration as his latest response to the pandemic, it is hard not to see the irony in America’s story. When Europeans first came to the United States, they brought with them new diseases, which devastated the communities who already lived here.</p>

                <p>Westfield is in its third week of remote learning, a change which has been difficult for all classes but which poses unique challenges for students with special needs and their teachers. No student has the same experience, and depending on their individual needs, they receive different support and resources within Westfield schools.</p>

                <p>There is a new hope for peace in Yemen. On February 7, a preliminary agreement was reached to remove Houthi troops from Hodeidah.

                <p>Buildings collapse. Bodies lie still in piles of rubble. Children scrounge for food. Smoke and flames paint the skies of cities. Bombs rain down, soldiers shoot and tanks pass through. But the way we talk about policy in Yemen is in relation to Iran and our foothold in the Middle East.</p>

                <p>History is about people.  It’s about how they lived, the events that shaped them, and the lives they changed.  Too often, the only history we learn about is the perspective provided by textbook publishers.  This singular view has had the power to shape our whole understanding of the past</p>
